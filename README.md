# Bioinformatics
This repository showcases various bioinformatics analyses that I have expertise with. Below is an overview of the analyses showcased in this repository:

* Differential gene expression analysis on bulk RNAseq data
* Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on bulk RNAseq data
* Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on bulk RNAseq data
* single cell RNAseq analyses using Seurat: Includes dimensionality reduction, clustering and cell type identification.
* single cell RNAseq analyses Monocle: Includes dimensionality reduction, clustering, cell type identification and differentiation trajectory analysis.

Upcoming projects:
* Snakemake
* Python script
* BASh shell script
* Spatial RNAseq
* GWAS analysis
* GenAI
