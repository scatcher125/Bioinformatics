# Bioinformatics
The repository `R_Workflows` showcases various bioinformatics analyses that I have expertise with. Below is an overview of the analyses showcased in this repository:

* Differential gene expression analysis using `edgeR` on bulk RNAseq data
* Gene set enrichment analysis (`GSEA`) on bulk RNAseq data
* Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (`WGCNA`) on bulk RNAseq data
* single cell RNAseq analyses using `Seurat`: Includes dimensionality reduction, clustering and cell type identification.

Upcoming projects:
* Single cell RNAseq analyses using `Monocle`: Includes dimensionality reduction, clustering, cell type identification and differentiation trajectory analysis.
* ATAC-seq methylation data analysis
* `Snakemake`
* Survival analysis using `survminer`
* `matchit`
* Python script
* BASh shell script
* Spatial RNAseq
* GWAS analysis
* GenAI

Disclaimer: All data in the `Interviews` portion is obtained from relevant publications.
